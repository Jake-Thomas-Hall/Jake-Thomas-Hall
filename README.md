## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile, I generally use this as a dumping ground for any random projects I work on. Most of these are probably of little value to anyone else, as they are mostly me learning how to (sometimes poorly...) write code.

### What type of development do I do?

As you can see in the below stats, according to this I mostly write JavaScript! This really isn't the case though, as I'm actually a C# developer for the most part, it's just that Github counts Javascript libraries as my own code in lots of projects.

I do however have quite a few contributed repositories where I've messed around with Javascript, PHP, Java and some other brief experiments like with Python.
